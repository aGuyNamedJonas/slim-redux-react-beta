## Introduction
So why `slim-redux-react`/ `slim-redux`?  
In two words: Less boilerplate.

While I admire the simplicity of the [core concepts of redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/CoreConcepts.html), I always found working with redux in react to be very overhead-heavy and at times incredibly confusing.  

I felt like it took me way more brain space and time to build react-redux apps than it should, considering the simplicity of redux itself.

`slim-redux` and `slim-redux-react` aim to solve this problem by providing a 100% compatible, but alternative interface for working with redux - standalone and inside react apps.

The basic ideas are as simple as redux itself:  
* **change triggers**: Bundle action and reducer code into on statement
* **subscriptions**: Easily subscribe to changes in a part of your state
* **calculations**: Derive values off of the state, using subscriptions
* **async change triggers**: Write async code which utilizes change triggers

Read on for a detailled description of the API, or skip to the [example]().
